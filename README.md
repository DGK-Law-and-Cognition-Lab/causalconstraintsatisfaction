# Constraint Satisfaction and Causal Power in Legal Reasoning

## Overview
This repository contains experimental materials and computational models investigating how constraint satisfaction processes and causal power attributions influence legal decision-making. The research examines whether evidence evaluation remains objective across different presentation contexts or becomes systematically biased through narrative construction processes.

## Background

Traditional models of legal reasoning assume that evidence can be evaluated independently of context. The harmless error doctrine in appellate law relies on this assumption, requiring judges to assess whether jury verdicts would have been the same without inadmissible evidence. However, psychological research on constraint satisfaction suggests that people construct coherent narratives by allowing beliefs to mutually influence each other until the system reaches a stable state.

This research integrates Simon and Holyoak's constraint satisfaction paradigm with Cheng's causal power theory to examine whether legal reasoning operates through rational evidence evaluation or becomes systematically influenced by coherence processes operating on causal power attributions.
